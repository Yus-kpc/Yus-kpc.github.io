<div class="bio"> 
  <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Yuichiro Suzuki</strong>  from Japan. Nice to meet you!</p>

   <p> I was born and raised in Japan until when I was 12 years old, when I flew to UK to study English.</p>
   <p> After graduating University of Auckland in New Zealand, I decided to persue a career in medicine in Japan.</p>
   <p> Now, I treat people with early gastric and colon cancers with endoscopy. </p>
